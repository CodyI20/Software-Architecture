This repo contains a Tower Defense game made in Unity

It uses programming patterns such as singleton, strategy, observer to create fluent, robust, reusable and expandable code.

The project also contains documentation on every .cs file and organized files inside the Unity project such as well defined folders and clear, representative names

The art inside the project is minimalistic since the aim of the project was to create great tooling for this game genre.
